The moment they scroll up to read something earlier, auto-scroll backs off and their position is preserved. You get smooth streaming without fighting the user's intent.",

One tap jumps them back to the newest message and re-engages auto-scroll. Same pattern as Slack or iMessage: quiet when you're caught up, helpful when you're not.",
